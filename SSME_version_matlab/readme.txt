This folder include the matlab script of building up a small-scale ME-model,
the coupling constraints of enzyme efficiencies (keff) in the ME-model is modeled
via the internal non-linear optimization package of Matlab, which simulates 
the phenotypes measured in Basan et al. 2015. Run "simulation_1.m" and "simulation_2.m".
